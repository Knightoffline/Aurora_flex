			<p>Forgottens varliği unutulmus bir irktir kendileri kanlari ölümsüzlüğün sirrini içerdiği gerekçesiyle yok edilmiştir. Kalan 3-5 kişinin soyu ise o kadar zamandir dünyadan uzaklar ki kimse onlari hatirlamiyor.</p>
			<p>Forgottens tamamen izole yaşarlar, ölen üyelerini anmak için dünyanin çeşitli yerlerine lahitler insa ederler, yaşamlarindaki halini temsilen bir santanc tasi olarak sembolize ederler.</p>
			<p>Forgottens kalplerinin derinlerinde derin bir intikam arzusu yatar ve bu duygu uyandiğinda onu durdurmak nerdeyse imkansizdir..</p>
			<h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
